# Tietokantasovellus-Movie-Reviews

Movie reviews will be a database application where users can add movie-reviews. Users will be able to 
* add movies to the database, 
* search for already existing movies and 
* read other users reviews. 
* Other users may like and upvote (or maybe also downvote) some reviews so that the most liked/popular/suited reviews stay on top. In other words, the list of the reviews is ordered by users votes. 
* The amount of the reviews could also be limited. 
* Maybe also add a feature where the movies may be sorted by 
1. genre
2.popularity (score) 
3. other critereas.⋅⋅
So one can search for a given genre and get a list sorted by the highest scores. 
* The same movie cannot be added to the database twice, that is if "Titanic" is in the database and one wants to review it one has to add a review to the already existing movie "Titanic" and not add a new "Titanic" to review.

The application will be written in Python. The users will have to authenticate themselves to the application (sing in) so that the users may be identified by their usernames. The application will have to have a possibility for signing up (creating a usersname+password).
